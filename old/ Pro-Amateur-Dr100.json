However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely, unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier \"pro-amateur\" end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance of small teams, \"crafting,\" and \"democracy\" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier end-users' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation. Understanding their practices and\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@ignore@"}
