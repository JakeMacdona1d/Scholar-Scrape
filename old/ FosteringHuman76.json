Due to the addition of artificial intelligence to teams, the behavioral functions of leaders need to be critically examined to determine their fit with the future of human-agent teamwork. This paper identifies these functional behaviors as resource management behaviors and information behaviors based on past research in teamwork. These behaviors are reviewed within the context of human-human teamwork to define human-oriented leadership behaviors. Based on the review of humanhuman teamwork along with recent research in human-agent teamwork, an adaptable framework is created for leadership behaviors that will help guide human leaders in human-agent teams. This framework provides a foundation for future human-agent teams to empower and guide human leaders of\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2021@c]]}@b"}
