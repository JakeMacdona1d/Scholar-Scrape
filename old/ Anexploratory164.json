Limited research has explored the demands placed on acute stroke caregivers in a telemedicine-integrated ambulance system. This study investigates the impact of telemedicine on workload, teamwork, workflow, and communication of geographically distributed caregivers delivering stroke care in ambulance-based telemedicine and usability of the system. Simulated stroke sessions were conducted with 27 caregivers, who subsequently completed a survey measuring workload, usability, and teamwork. Follow-up interviews with each caregiver ascertained how telemedicine affected workflow and demands which were analyzed for barriers and facilitators to using telemedicine. Caregivers experienced moderate workload and rated team effectiveness and usability high\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2021@c]]}@b"}
