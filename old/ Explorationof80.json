A Wizard of Oz methodology is used to simulate the autonomous teammate. One of the critical aspects of HAT performance is the trust that develops over time as team members interact with each other in a dynamic task environment. For this reason, it is important to examine the dynamic nature of teammate trust through real-time measures of team interactions. This article examines team interaction and trust to understand better how they change under automation and autonomy failures. Thus, we address two research questions: 1) How does trust in HATs evolve over time?; and 2) How is the relationship between team interaction and trust\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2021@c]]}@b"}
