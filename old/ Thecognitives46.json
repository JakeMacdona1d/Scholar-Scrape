The pressures that intelligence analysts must deal with on a day-to-day basis stretch one\u2019s cognitive bandwidth. Through a review of human factors related intelligence analysis research, this paper presents multiple cognitive challenges that impact intelligence analysts\u2019 work. In response to these challenges, the authors outline ways in which human factors can be beneficial to alleviating many of the challenges. Finally, the authors introduce the Living Lab approach as a valuable and unique means for understanding the cognitive science of intelligence analysis.", "issued": "@ignore@"}
