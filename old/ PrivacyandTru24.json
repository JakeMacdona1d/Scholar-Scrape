While this chapter mostly presents timeless aspects of privacy and trust, it aims to offer a primer targeted at researchers and practitioners who work on contemporary computing technologies, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) systems and social technologies. The two main components of this primer are a section covering theoretical perspectives that can be employed to conceptualize privacy and trust, and a section covering the methods that can be employed to measure these concepts. Specific opportunities for HCI researchers and practitioners are provided throughout this chapter.", "issued": "2024/8/2"}
