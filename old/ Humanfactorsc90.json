This challenge is particularly dangerous in human-AI teams, where the AI holds a unique role in the team\u2019s success. Thus, it is imperative that researchers find solutions for designing AI team-mates that consider their human team-mates\u2019 needs in their adaptation logic. This study explores adaptive autonomy as a solution to overcoming these challenges. We conducted twelve contextual inquiries with professionals in two teaming contexts in order to understand how human teammate perceptions can be used to determine optimal autonomy levels for AI team-mates. The results of this study will enable the human factors community to develop AI team-mates that can enhance their team\u2019s performance while\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2024/7/25"}
