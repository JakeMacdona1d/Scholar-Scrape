Specifically, we present an empirical study of the technological practices in an emerging creative technology community \u2013 independent [indie] game developers in the United States. Based on indie game developers\u2019 own accounts, we identified four themes that constitute an innovation ecology from the bottom up, including problem solving; collaborative information seeking, sharing, and reproducing; community support; and policy and politics. We argue that these findings inform our understanding of bottom up technological innovation and shed light on the design of sociotechnical systems to mediate and support such innovation beyond the gaming context.", "issued": "@ignore@"}
