We do this by first characterizing what sets team cognition and collectively intelligence apart, and then reviewing the literature on \u201csuperforecasting\u201d and the ability for effectively coordinated teams to outperform predictions by large groups. Lastly, we delve into the ways in which teamwork can be enhanced by artificial intelligence through our model, finally highlighting the many areas of research worth exploring through interdisciplinary efforts.", "issued": "@ignore@"}
