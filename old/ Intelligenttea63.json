This paper provides a historical foundation to various elements of human-agent collaboration, leading to the identification of research needs and challenges that are often present when teamwork is seen from the vantage point of cognitive augmentation. A broad research framework consisting of four meshed phases derives from the historical foundation and research needs and challenges to help integrate multifarious considerations involving information, technology, people, and environment is presented. Examples and lessons learned associated with each phase are provided to help articulate requisite bottlenecks and tradeoffs that inevitability arise when agents, aids, and interfaces are purposefully human-centered in their approach. The objectives of understanding, usefulness, usability, and context are examined in consort with each phase.", "issued": "@ignore@"}
