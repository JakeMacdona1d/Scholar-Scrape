However, these teams often face performance challenges due to mismatches between human expectations and AI capabilities, hindering the effectiveness of these future workforce teams. Addressing these discrepancies, team training, particularly cross-training, has emerged as a promising intervention to align expectations and enhance team dynamics. This study explores the efficacy of different cross-training approaches and human/AI team role assignments on team training reactions and perceived task performance in an advertising co-creation task. The findings suggest that cross-training significantly improves both training reactions and task performance perceptions.
