The current research focuses on how human operators can effectively team with autonomous urban search and rescue agents in a dynamic and complex task environment. To do so, we empirically examined how shared cognition and restricted language capabilities impacted performance of human-robot dyad search teams using a simulated Minecraft task environment. In order to examine the effects of shared mental models and language the following modified conditions were applied: (1) participants were either able to communicate using natural language or the internal participant's communication was limited to three-word utterances; and (2) shared mental models were manipulated by either the internal participant being made fully aware of the external participant's\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@ignore@"}
