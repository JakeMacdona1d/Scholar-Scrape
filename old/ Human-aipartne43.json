However, is randomization the best approach to expose faults within a system? We aim to answer this question by introducing Chaos into different software architecture patterns and demonstrate how a back-end system can be made fault tolerant through artificial intelligence (AT). This paper discusses what aspects of AI would be used to make a system more resilient to perturbations and the results of these findings against existing chaos engineering approaches.", "issued": "@ignore@"}
