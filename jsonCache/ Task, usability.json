The goals of this study were to 1) study how clinicians complete stroke assessment using a telemedicine system integrated in ambulances, 2) determine potential errors and usability issues when using the system, and 3) develop recommendations to mitigate these issues. This study investigated use of a telemedicine platform to evaluate a stroke patient in an ambulance with a geographically distributed caregiving team comprised of a paramedic, nurse, and neurologist. It first determined the tasks involved based on 13 observations of a simulated stroke using 39 care providers. Based on these observational studies, a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) was developed, and subsequently, a heuristic evaluation was conducted to determine the usability issues in the interface of the\u00a0\u2026"}
