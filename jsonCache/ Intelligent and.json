This dynamic is particularly apparent in the operating room, where for each operation, doctors and nurses have to make sure each surgery condition is optimal to avoid surgery complications and the spread of infections. Checklists are a helpful tool to avoid glossing over these critical steps, but their current implementation is outdated and does not leverage human-centered technology. We propose a checklist design for operating rooms that is generated by an intelligent system and is interacted with through a voice interface. By removing this burden away from the nursing staff, routine safety procedures can be expedited, and practitioners can redirect their full attention to the operation at hand."}
