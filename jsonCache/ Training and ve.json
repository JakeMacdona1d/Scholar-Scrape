However, the inclusion of autonomous artificial agents presents challenges to teamwork. This study sought to examine the effects of three different training approaches on team communication behaviors in human-autonomy teams (HATs) under normal and degraded conditions. Teams were split into three conditions prior to execution of missions in a remotely piloted aircraft system task environment: coordination training, calibration training, and control training. Analysis of text communications indicated that teams that received coordination training push information more frequently compared to teams that received control or calibration training, though this effect appeared to diminish over time. Teams in all three conditions pulled information equally, with a reduction in frequency over time. It was also found that teams that\u00a0\u2026"}
