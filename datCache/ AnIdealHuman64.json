While human-AI collaboration has been investigated in various domains, more research is needed to explore human perceptions and expectations of AI teammates in human-AI teaming. To achieve an in-depth understanding of how people perceive AI teammates and what they expect from AI teammates in human-AI teaming, we conducted a survey with 213 participants and a follow-up interview with 20 participants. Considering the context-dependency of teamwork, we chose to study human-AI teaming in the context of multiplayer online games as a case study. This study shows that people have mixed feelings toward AI teammates but hold a positive attitude toward future collaboration with AI teammates in general. Our findings highlight people's expectations for AI\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2021@c]]}@b"}
