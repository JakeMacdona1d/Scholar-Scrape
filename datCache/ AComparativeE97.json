However, the current literature lacks unbiased evaluations of applied AA or AI teammates compared to human counterparts in HAT settings. Existing evaluations are often influenced by participants\u2019 prior experiences and expectations, rather than providing a current assessment. To address this gap, we conducted a single-blind preliminary study, assessing the perceptions of 10 participants in Human-Human and Human-AA teams using the Paladins Multiplayer Online Games (MPOG) platform.", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[2018]]}@b"}
