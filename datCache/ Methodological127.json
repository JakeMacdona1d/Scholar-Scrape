It presents a set of cognitively oriented methodologies that can be used in CIS research. The chapter explores a metafamily of cognitive-elicitation techniques known as knowledge elicitation (KE). It also discusses the cognitive task analysis (CTA). The chapter also presents the living laboratory (LL) approach. CIS has been studied in both library/information sciences and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) mainly through two streams of research: social and technical. CIS is also studied in varied variety of contexts including education, military, and medical settings. CIS research focuses mostly on social and technical streams, but there has been little research examining CIS and cognition, specifically team cognition\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2017@c]]}@b"}
