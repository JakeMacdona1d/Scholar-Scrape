While critical past research has shown the benefit to trust driven by the incorporation of interaction rules and structures (i.e. etiquette) in both AI tools and robotic teammates, research has yet to explicitly examine etiquette for digital AI teammates. Given the historic importance of trust within human-agent teams, the identification of etiquette\u2019s impact within said teams should be paramount. Thus, this study empirically evaluates the impact of AI teammate etiquette through a mixed-methods study that compares AI teammates that either adhere to or ignore traditional etiquette standards for machine systems. The quantitative results show that traditional etiquette adherence leads to greater trust, perceived performance of the AI, and perceived performance of\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/3/26"}
