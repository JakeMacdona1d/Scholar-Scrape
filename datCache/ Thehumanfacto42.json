Yet, the scope and breadth of IA is growing and evolving for many different reasons. IA is more dynamic and multi-faceted than it has ever been. The process of IA is changing due to expanding sensor data, new methods of work, new technologies, and new challenges. In addition, the scope and context of IA is greater than ever, including focuses such as healthcare, climate change, and cyber security (to name a few). In response to these changes, a few key questions emerge. Panel discussants will provide insights into how IA is changing, how researchers should adapt to this change, how researchers should acquire access to study IA, and if there are there underlying assumptions and themes of IA that are true across different domains.", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2015@c]]}@b"}
