With the increased popularity of grounded theory, many researchers have sought to use ever-increasingly large datasets to analyze and draw patterns about social dynamics. However, the data is simply too big to enable a single human to derive effective models for many complex social phenomena. Computational methods offer a unique opportunity to analyze a wide spectrum of sociological events by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Within the human factors community, machine learning has emerged as the dominant AI-approach to deal with big data. However, along with its many benefits, machine learning has introduced a unique challenge: interpretability. The models of macro-social behavior generated by AI are so\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2018/9"}
