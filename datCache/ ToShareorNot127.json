This lack of familiarity can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings, hindering effective teamwork. Derived from research in social recommender systems, team recommender systems have shown the ability to address this challenge by providing personality- derived recommendations that help individuals interact with teammates with differing personalities. However, such an approach raises privacy concerns as to whether teammates would be willing to disclose such personal information with their team. Using a vignette survey conducted via a research platform that hosts a team recommender system, this study found that context and individual differences significantly impact disclosure preferences related to team recommender\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2024/2/21"}
