This advancement is driving new research investigations into the applicability of human-human teamwork knowledge to the context of human-autonomy teaming. In the current study, we apply qualitative methods to explore how the perceived composition of a team (how many humans and how many agents on the team) affects sentiments toward teammates, team processes, cognitive states, and the emergence of a system of team cognition. A total of 46 teams completed a teamwork simulation task and were interviewed afterwards regarding their teamwork experience. All of the teams were comprised of only humans; however, two conditions were led to believe that their teammate(s) were autonomous agents. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2021@c]]}@b"}
