It can be defined as getting the right information from the right person within the right amount of time, in order to overcome an unexpected event (Gorman, Cooke, Pederson, Connor, &amp; DeJoode, 2005). TSA is developed and maintained through team interactions, allowing for the measurement of TSA based on team interaction (Cooke &amp; Gorman, 2009). In the current study, a specific measure, Coordinated Awareness of Situation by Teams (CAST) is used (Cooke &amp; Gorman, 2009). CAST evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of team interaction under \u201croadblock\u201d scenarios (Gorman, Cooke, &amp; Winner, 2006). These roadblocks represent novel situations in the task and require effective team communication and coordination. Team members must assess the situation according to\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@ignore@"}
