To be included, an article should consist of an experimental study investigating the use of collaborative AR for learning in higher education settings. An initial search was conducted on five databases that resulted in a total of 2537 articles, of which 20 were finalized for this review. The main findings suggest that AR-enabled collaborative learning benefits students\u2019 overall learning outcomes and provides a positive collaboration experience in higher education settings. Further research is needed to determine the interaction elements, collaboration mechanisms, and information representation through AR that would potentially enhance student learning outcomes. This article concludes by discussing the implications of these\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2024/11/1"}
