This article outlines an experimental research study that investigates essential aspects of human-AI teaming such as team performance, team situation awareness, and perceived team cognition in various mixed composition teams (human-only, human-human-AI, human-AI-AI, and AI-only) through a simulated emergency response management scenario. Results indicate dichotomous outcomes regarding perceived team cognition and performance metrics, as perceived team cognition was not predictive of performance. Performance metrics like team situational awareness and team score showed that teams composed of all human participants\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2021/5/23"}
