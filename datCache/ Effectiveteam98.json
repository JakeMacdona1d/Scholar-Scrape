We address training solutions to distinct types of failures caused by either internal (the system) and external sources (the dynamic task environment). In order to accomplish this, we explore Human-Autonomy teaming communication and coordination with comprehensive scenarios drawn from the pilot tests and look at team needs to successfully overcome complex and dynamic failures. Findings from these two failure events are two-fold: (1) in order to adapt to dynamic environments and overcome unexpected failures, teams should receive role-related training (static and knowledge-based) as well as training about how to interact with one another (dynamic and coordination-based) and (2) designing synthetic agents with effective team coordination mechanisms will help\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2019/4/8"}
