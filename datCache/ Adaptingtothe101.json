We conducted a search on <i>adaptive autonomy</i> and additional relevant search terms in four databases, which produced an initial 245 articles. The application of inclusion and exclusion criteria produced a total of 60 articles for in-depth review. Through a collaborative coding process and analysis, we extracted triggers for and types of autonomy adaptations, as well as human factors dependent variables that have been studied in previous adaptive autonomy research. Based on this analysis, we present a definition of <i>adaptive autonomy</i> for use in human factors artificial intelligence research, as well as a comprehensive review of existing research contributions, notable research gaps, and the application of adaptive autonomy.", "issued": "2024/10/1"}
