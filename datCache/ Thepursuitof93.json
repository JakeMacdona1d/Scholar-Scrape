Due to this rising importance, it has become essential to understand the interpersonal dynamism between humans and AI to further optimise their performance potential. Given the demonstrated utility of emotional communication within human-human team structures, this research investigates the nature of AI-sourced positive emotions on human teammates. Through 47 interviews, our findings show that for these AI teammates to be accepted, human teammates have preferences on understanding the emotional utility prior to its presentation, as well as which emotions are situationally acceptable. Also, findings show that integrating emotions within AI teammates has a positive influence on human perceptions and behaviour in a task.
