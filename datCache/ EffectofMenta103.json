However, as previous research has found, human trust and task workload, two essential elements for successful human-automation interaction, are impacted by the reliability of the automation: a decrease in reliability reduces human trust (Lee &amp; See, 2004; Muir &amp; Moray, 1996) and increases task workload (Lee &amp; See, 2004; Dixon &amp; Wickens, 2004). Similarly, the fatigue of the human, one of the leading contributors to errors and accidents in the aviation (Isaac et al., 2002) and automotive (Fritzsche et al., 2014) domains, has also been found to affect trust in automation, with the\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2022/9"}
