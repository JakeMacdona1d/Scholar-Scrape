As such, continuing to frame human-autonomy teams as technologically advanced human-human teams might not only restrict the global effectiveness of these teams but doing so might also stagnate these teams from being well perceived and respected by humans. However, recent efforts to differentiate human-autonomy teams have prioritized the differentiation from human-autonomy interactions rather than human-human teams. The following article further differentiates human-autonomy teams from human-human teams by first discussing the core differentiating\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/11/1"}
