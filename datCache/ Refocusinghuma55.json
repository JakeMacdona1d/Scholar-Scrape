Over the last few decades, computational systems have been mostly relegated to automating basic and repetitive tasks alongside humans, thus creating human\u2013automation interaction (Lee &amp; See, 2004). However, the last few years have seen major strides made in artificial intelligence (AI) allowing for more dynamic and complex problems to be solved. What separates the technologies is that automation is often task-oriented and lacks the flexibility to handle changes in the task it was designed for (known as brittleness), but AI has the capability to handle tasks with dynamic features and may even have the potential to handle multiple tasks in a dynamic environment, which also makes it more capable of working alongside humans in these environments (Wynne &amp; Lyons\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/5/18"}
