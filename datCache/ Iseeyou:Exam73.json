This significant background gives awareness the ability to answer challenges facing human-agent teams in communication and shared understanding. As such, the current study investigates the effects of spatial information level (low, high) on the development of team cognition and its outcomes in varying compositions of human-agent teams (human-human-agent, human-agent-agent) versus human-only (human-human-human) teams. The mixed-methods study had teams complete several rounds of the NeoCITIES emergency response management simulation and complete various team cognition and perception measures, followed by qualitative free-response questions. The study found that human-only teams did not perform at the same level as human\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2022/11/11"}
