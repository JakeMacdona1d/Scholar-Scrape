In particular, we draw upon the incredible amount of research work                         done that indelibly the result of team simulations. Much of our own work                         emerged from the use of technology-enabled team simulations. This chapter                         reviews this work along with earlier foundations that set up and                         substantiate the study of teams both for collocated and distributed                         settings. This chapter presents Part I of team simulation research that\u00a0\u2026", "date": "2020/9/28"}
