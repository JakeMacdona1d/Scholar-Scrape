Specifically, team situation awareness (TSA) and team conflict are examined in human\u2013machine teams. There is a significant need to identify how TSA and team conflict occur during human\u2013machine teaming, in addition to how they impact each other. In this work, we present an experiment aimed at understanding TSA and team conflict in the context of human\u2013machine teaming in a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Three conditions were tested: (1) <i>control</i>: teams consisted of all humans; (2) <i>synthetic</i>: teams consisted of the pilot role being occupied by a computational agent based on ACT-R architecture that employed AI capabilities, with all other team roles being humans; and (3) <i>experimenter</i>: an experimenter playing the role of the pilot as a highly effective\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2021/9"}
