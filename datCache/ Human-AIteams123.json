As human information processing capabilities are limited, processing the required scale of information increases the decision-makers\u2019 workload, impacting their situational awareness and affecting the quality of soldiers\u2019 decisions. This study uses a route clearance task as a use-case scenario to understand the issues in team-level decision-making in military tasks, the challenges in successfully completing the mission, and the demands placed on AI teammates when working in a human-AI team. We interviewed eight subject matter experts with prior experience in route clearance operations. The themes generated by analyzing the interview transcripts provide insights into soldiers\u2019 perceptions of AI teammates as well as recommendations for successfully integrating human-AI\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/9"}
