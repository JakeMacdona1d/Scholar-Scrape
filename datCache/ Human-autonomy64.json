Enabled through the rapid progression of artificial intelligence, a human-autonomy team (HAT) involves one or more autonomous computerized agents collaborating with humans on interdependent tasks toward the achievement of a common goal. Whereas research on HATs is exploding in recent years, that research has not strongly embraced the vast literature, theory, and methods already developed in the all-human teaming literature. Moreover, definitional and construct validity issues, in terms of what constitutes a HAT, persist in the literature. In the current article we offer construct clarity and we integrate the Input-Mediator-Output model from the high-performance teaming literature to help future researchers classify the variables under study, theorize deeper, and consolidate findings across\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/9/1"}
