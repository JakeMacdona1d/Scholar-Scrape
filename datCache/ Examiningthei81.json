However, AI teammates themselves are not static, and their roles and responsibilities in human-AI teams are likely to change as technologies advance in the coming years. As a result of this advancement, AI teammates will gain influence in teams, which refers to their ability to change and manipulate a team\u2019s shared resources. This study uses a mixed-methods experiment to examine how the amount of influence AI teammates have on a team\u2019s shared resources can impact the team outcomes of human teammate performance, teammate perceptions, and whole-team perception. Results indicate that AI teammates that increase their influence on shared resources over time can stagnate the improvement of human performance, but AI teammates that decrease their influence on shared\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/9/1"}
