This included nationally televised presidential addresses on early coping efforts. We examine the impact of these communications by using public Twitter data to explore Ugandans\u2019 experiences, conversations, and engagement leading up to, during, and after these addresses. We found that tweets from verified accounts received more user engagement than tweets from non-verified accounts. We also used a Louvian clustering algorithm to identify the topics around which tweet clusters occurred. Some topics were unique to Uganda\u2019s COVID-19 response, such as lockdown and truck drivers. Thematic analyses within the five clusters uncovered sub-themes on conversation dynamics, and Twitter use during the pandemic. Overall, we use Uganda as a case example of using social media in a crisis (such as a pandemic) to provide insight into the African experience."}
