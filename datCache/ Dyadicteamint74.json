With that in mind, we examined how shared cognition and restricted language capabilities impact performance of human dyadic teams using a simulated Minecraft task environment. In this human dyadic team, an internal teammate (comparable to robot) identifies the location of victims while navigating inside a game environment that reflects a collapsed building; and an external teammate (comparable to operator) sees their teammate's actions from a different screen and guides them through the environment, tracking the location of victims on a map as they go. In order to examine the effects of language and shared cognition, a two by two design was chosen: (1) in the communication manipulation, participants are either able to\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2018@c]]}@b"}
