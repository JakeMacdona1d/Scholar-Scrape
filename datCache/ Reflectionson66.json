The chapter begins with a review                         and delves into specific research issues that are unmistakably coupled with                         the interrelationships among teamwork, cognition, technologies, and context.                         The chapter then articulates actual research findings from the use of                         various simulations that have advanced distributed team cognition to                         formulate the field it is today. Finally, a comprehensive framework is                         presented as a way to think about and conduct research within distributed                         team cognition. At the heart of the chapter is the idea that                         interdisciplinary research science is necessary as a worldview to bring\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2020/9/28"}
