Within these breakout sessions, students are expected to work together to complete an assignment. Through 669 surveys and 19 interviews, our paper outlines the successes and challenges of breakout sessions and teamwork in virtual learning environments faced by professors, graduate teaching assistants, and students. Our findings show the importance of pedagogical research for online environments, the student need for persistent instructions and check-ins to facilitate teamwork in breakout sessions, and strong justification for the use of breakout sessions in online courses. Based on our findings, we propose design\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/4/16"}
