In order for the synthetic teammate to function as team player with human teammates, it needs to skillfully handle the subtleties of team communication and coordination. Data from early synthetic teammate interactions with two human teammates are presented here to illustrate team communication and coordination challenges for the synthetic teammate. In turn, the synthetic teammate limitations have highlighted the intricacies involved in effective teamwork. Communication, though a terrifically challenging problem in itself, is only a foundation for coordinated teamwork or interacting as a team player.", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2015@c]]}@b"}
