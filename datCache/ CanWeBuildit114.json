Our process begins by first identifying an appropriate contextual situation that warrants humans teaming with AI as opposed to other team-based configurations. Those criteria are based on the delegation of roles appropriate to the established strengths of humans/AI, as well as the interdependence created between those roles to accentuate the expectations of teammate behavior. Next, qualitative interviews should be conducted with diverse subject matter experts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the environmental attributes through various perspectives. Once analyzed using thematic analysis, themes present themselves as design\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/9"}
