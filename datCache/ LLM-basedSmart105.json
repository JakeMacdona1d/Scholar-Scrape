The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has revolutionized conversational agents, employing advanced deep learning techniques to generate context-aware, coherent, and personalized responses. Consequently, LLM-based AI assistants provide a more natural and efficient user experience across various scenarios. In this paper, we study how LLM models can be used to improve work efficiency in collaborative workplaces. Specifically, we present an LLM-based Smart Reply (LSR) system utilizing the ChatGPT to generate personalized responses in professional collaborative scenarios while adapting to context and communication style based on prior responses. Our two-step process involves generating a preliminary response type (eg, Agree, Disagree) to provide a generalized direction for message generation, thus reducing response drafting time. We conducted an experiment where participants completed simulated work tasks involving a Dual N-back test and subtask scheduling through Google Calendar while interacting with co-workers. Our findings indicate that the proposed LSR reduces overall workload, as measured by the NASA TLX, and improves work performance and productivity in the N-back task. We also provide qualitative analysis based on participants\u2019 experiences, as well as design considerations to provide future directions for improving such implementations.", "issued": "2023/6"}
