An HSI perspective is described in the context of the Two Eagles mission, in which two pilots crossed the Pacific Ocean in a gas balloon. The two pilots set both the record for the longest duration and for the longest distance in a gas balloon. The system extended far beyond the balloon and the two pilots. It was complex and distributed around the world. There were many challenges associated with HSI issues, which are detailed in this paper and exemplify the value of a systems perspective.", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2016@c]]}@b"}
