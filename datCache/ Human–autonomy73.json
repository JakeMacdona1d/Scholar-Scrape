Specifically, we identify the research environments, dependent variables, themes representing the key findings, and critical future research directions.BACKGROUND: >Whereas a burgeoning literature on high-performance teamwork identifies the factors critical to success, much less is known about how human\u2013autonomy teams (HATs) achieve success. Human\u2013autonomy teamwork involves humans working interdependently toward a common goal along with autonomous agents. Autonomous agents involve a degree of self-government and self-directed behavior (agency), and autonomous agents take on a unique role or set of tasks and work interdependently with human team members to achieve a shared objective.METHODS: >We searched the literature on human\u2013autonomy teaming.
