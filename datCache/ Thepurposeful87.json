Study 1\u2019s results indicated that AI teammates are accepted when they share equal responsibility on a task with humans, but other perceptions such as job security generally decline the more responsibility AI teammates have. Study 1 also revealed that identifying an AI as a tool instead of a teammate can have small benefits to human perceptions of job security and adoption. Study 2 revealed that the negative impacts of increasing responsibility can be mitigated by presenting AI teammates\u2019 capabilities as being endorsed by coworkers and one\u2019s own past experience. This paper discusses how to use these results to best balance the presentation of AI teammates\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/9/10"}
