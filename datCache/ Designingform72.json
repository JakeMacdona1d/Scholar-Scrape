Based on the well-known Recognition Primed Decision-Making Model, our framework expands upon RPD\u2019s single decision maker to be more Human-Agent Teaming (HAT) oriented. Specifically, our framework includes three layers of shared cognition to ensure both a consistent level of transparency between members and the efficient completion of the task. The first layer provides itself as a foundation of expectations that provides familiarity recognition in a situation. The second layer categorizes the environmental features into relevant decisions informing the symbiotic nature of who should and how to enact decisions collaboratively, which is the third layer. Altogether, this mutually beneficial decision-making model emphasizes\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2022/9"}
