Artificial intelligence systems may be unreliable or insufficiently robust; however, due to challenges in the development of reliable and robust AI algorithms based on datasets that are noisy and incomplete, the lack of causal models needed for projecting future outcomes, the presence of undetected biases, and noisy or faulty sensor inputs. Therefore, it is anticipated that for the foreseeable future, AI systems will need to operate in conjunction with humans in order to perform their tasks, and often as a part of a larger team of humans and AI systems. Further, AI systems may be instantiated with different levels of autonomy, at different times, and for different types of tasks\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2022/12"}
