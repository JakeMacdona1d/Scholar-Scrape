Several of these fields are social in nature, including decision-making and teaming, which introduces a new set of challenges for AI research. While each of these fields has its unique challenges, the area of human-AI teaming is beset with many that center around the expectations and abilities of AI teammates. One such challenge is understanding team cognition in these human-AI teams and AI teammates\u2019 ability to contribute towards, support, and encourage it. Team cognition is defined as any cognitive activity among the team members regarding their shared knowledge of the team and task, including concepts such as shared task or team mental models, team situation awareness, or schema similarity. Team cognition is fundamental to effective teams, as it is\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/12"}
