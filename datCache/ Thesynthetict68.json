The current project is part of a larger effort that focuses on Human-Automation Teaming (HAT) interaction in the context of the development, integration, and validation of a computational cognitive model that acts as a full-fledged synthetic teammate for a three-agent Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) ground control crew. Our most recent effort looked at team process and team performance within the HAT. In order to be considered a team player, the synthetic teammate must be able to communicate and coordinate with its human teammates and do so in a subtle manner (Demir et al., 2016). In this task, there were three different and interdependent team members: 1) Air Vehicle Operator (AVO) \u2013 controls the UAS\u2019s heading, altitude, and airspeed; 2) Data Exploitation, Mission Planning, and Communications (DEMPC) \u2013 provides a dynamic flight plan as well as speed and altitude restrictions; and 3\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@ignore@"}
