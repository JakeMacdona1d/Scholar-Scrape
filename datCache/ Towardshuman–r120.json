However, challenges remain in developing robot capabilities suitable for teaming with humans. Communicating effectively is one of these challenges, especially if plan deviations during field operations require robot explanation. A virtual USAR team task experiment was conducted in Minecraft with a confederate acting as the remote robot. Four explanation-based communication conditions were tested: (1) always explain\u2013the robot automatically provided explanations for any off-plan behaviors, (2) explain if asked\u2013the robot provided an explanation only when the human counterpart requests it, (3) pull prime\u2013the same as (2) but participants also experienced implicit\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2022@c]]}@b"}
