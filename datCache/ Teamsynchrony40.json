Similar to human-human teaming, there are multiple dimensions of social behaviors that occur during HAT that must be accounted for within the development of the agent or system. One of these dimensions is team synchrony. In general, team synchrony is, when two systems (or two individuals in a team) are synchronized, resulting in their recurrences being dependent on each other. In order for a human-autonomy team to be synchronous the agent must communicate effectively (i.e., synchronize effectively) with its human team members. Thus, in this paper we present a conceptual discussion on what team synchrony is, how it occurs, and how to better develop it in HAT. To ground our discussion, we use our recent studies in which we empirically looked at team behaviors and team synchrony\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[2018]]}@b"}
