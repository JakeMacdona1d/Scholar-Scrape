Our work is motivated by calls for socially responsible AI development and governance in the face of societal harm but a lack of accountability across the entire socio-technical system. In particular, we explore a gap in the field stemming from the lack of empirical data needed to conclude how real AI professionals view bias mitigation and why individual AI professionals may be prevented from taking accountability even if they have the technical ability to do so. This gap is concerning as larger responsible AI efforts inherently rely on individuals who contribute to designing, developing, and deploying AI technologies and mitigation solutions. Through semi-structured interviews with AI professionals from diverse roles, organizations, and industries working on development projects, we identify that AI professionals\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2024/3/20"}
