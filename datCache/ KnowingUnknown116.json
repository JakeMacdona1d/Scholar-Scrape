Due to the unfamiliar nature of these teams, teammates are often limited by their understanding of one another (e.g., teammate preferences, tendencies, attitudes) which limits the team's functioning and efficiency. This study conceptualizes and investigates the use of a teammate information-sharing recommender system which selectively shares interpersonal recommendations between unfamiliar teammates (e.g., \"Your voice may be overshadowed by this teammate when making decisions...\") to promote teammate understanding. Through a mixed-methods approach involving 105 participants working on actual unfamiliar teams, this study explores how presentation elements such as anonymity and explanations influence system perceptions\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/10/4"}
