An Unexpected Path to Work Meaningfulness\u201d by Go\u0161tautait\u0117, Liubert\u0117, Parker, and Bu\u010di\u016bnien\u0117 (2023) examines how people handled the integration of industrial robots into two Lithuanian manufacturing facilities. We applaud the authors for this work and we hope scholars will continue to examine how humans can work in a healthy way alongside robots, artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and disembodied agent peers both now and in the future of work. In particular, much more fieldwork like this is needed to help guide our understanding of modern technological appropriation by humans. The article by Go\u0161tautait\u0117 et al.(2023) was concerned with human work meaningfulness in the context of low-reliability robots, as well as automation and autonomy more broadly. The authors offer several interesting observations about their findings that have important implications to\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2024/3"}
