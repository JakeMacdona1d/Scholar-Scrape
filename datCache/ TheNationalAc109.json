This consensus study was conducted by the National Academies Board on Human-Systems Integration (BOHSI). This panel, organized by BOHSI, brings together prominent researchers, including several members of the consensus committee, to discuss the state of the art and research frontiers for development of effective human-AI teams that can operate resiliently in complex, data intensive, and dynamically paced environments.", "issued": "2022/9"}
