The level and sophistication of this interaction will only continue to grow in upcoming years, as intelligent technology continues to advance from automation to autonomous capabilities. In this chapter, we provide a historical context on research that has been conducted on humans interacting with machines. Principles of <i>extraordinary human\u2013robotic interaction (EHRI)</i> are outlined to better understand effective and meaningful human\u2013robot interaction. Finally, a discussion regarding the design and development of EHRI is presented. In this section, we present frameworks on how to both study and design EHRI.", "issued": "2020/1/1"}
