Students worked in two different teams, in face-to-face and online environments, to solve complex manufacturing design challenges posed by their instructor. The students were assessed using an observational rubric with four dimensions: <i>peer interactions</i>, <i>positive communication</i>, <i>tools and methods</i> and <i>iteration and adaption</i>, and scored via each dimension\u2019s associated attributes, and subsequently interviewed. Six students scored emergent or proficient in CPS and had slightly higher CPS scores during the second observation. One student demonstrated a limited ability for CPS and the observable CPS skills decreased during the project. Interviews revealed the importance of (1) relying on instructor and student chosen technologies for collaborative tasks, (2) recognising\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2021/9/2"}
