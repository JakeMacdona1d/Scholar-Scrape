Yet, while this importance has been recognized there is a lack of research on team cognition within CIS. We take the position that team cognition concepts and measurements can be very useful to CIS researchers. This paper provides an understanding of what team mental models and common ground are. We then present methodological measurements for studying team cognition during CIS. We conclude by highlighting the important relationship of CIS and team mental models and common ground.", "issued": "@b{@cdate-parts@c:[[@c2013@c]]}@b"}
