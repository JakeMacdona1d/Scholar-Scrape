A controlled experiment (N = 190) was conducted to study the effects of the presented justification for the recommendations (teachers\u2019 needs vs. their interests) and the presented source of the recommendations (a human expert vs. an AI algorithm) on users\u2019 perceptions of and experience with the system. Our results show an interaction effect between these two system aspects: users who are told that the recommendations are based on their interests have a better experience when the recommendations are presented as originating from an AI algorithm, while users who are told that the recommendations are based on their needs have a better experience when\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2022/6/28"}
