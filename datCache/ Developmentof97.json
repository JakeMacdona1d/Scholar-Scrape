To develop a trust metric that consists of objective variables influenced by trust/distrust manipulations, we conducted an Interactive hybrid Cognitive Task Analysis (IhCTA) for a Remotely Piloted Aerial System (RPAS) HAT. The IhCTA adapted parts of the hybrid Cognitive Task Analysis (hCTA) framework. In this paper, we present the four steps of the IhCTA approach, including 1) generating a scenario task overview, 2) generating teammate-specific event flow diagrams, 3) identifying interactions and interdependencies impacted by trust/distrust manipulations, and 4) processing RPAS variables based on the IhCTA to create a metric. We demonstrate the application of the metric through a case study that examines how the influence of specific\u00a0\u2026", "issued": "2023/9"}
