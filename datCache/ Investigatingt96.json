While these teammates have great potential in improving team performance, empirical work that explores the impacts of these teammates on the humans they work with is still in its infancy. Thus, this study explores how the inclusion of AI teammates impacts both the performative abilities of human-AI teams in addition to the perceptions those humans form. The current study found that participants perceiving their third teammate as artificial performed worse than those perceiving them as human. Furthermore, these performance differences were significantly moderated by the task\u2019s difficulty, with participants in the AI teammate condition significantly outperforming participants perceiving a human teammate in the highest difficulty task, which diverges from previous human-AI teaming literature\u00a0\u2026"}
