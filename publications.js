{title: "Adapt and overcome: Perceptions of adaptive autonomous agents for human-AI teaming", author: "Allyson I Hauptman, Beau G Schelble, Nathan J McNeese, Kapil Chalil Madathil", link: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G1CnZ38AAAAJ&pagesize=50&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=G1CnZ38AAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", abstract: "BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in AI technologies have caused teams to explore the use of AI agents as full, active members of the team. The complex environments that teams occupy require human team members to constantly adapt their behaviors, and thus the ability of AI teammates to similarly adapt to changing situations significantly enhances the team\u2019s chances to succeed. In order to design such agents, it is important that we understand not only how to identify the amount of autonomous control AI agents have over their decisions, but also how changes to this control cognitively affects the rest of the team. Professional organizations often break their work cycles into phases that set limits on the team members\u2019 actions, and we propose that a similar process could be used to define the autonomy levels of AI teammates. Cyber incident response is an ideal context for this proposal, as we were able to use incident response\u00a0\u2026"},
{title: "An integrative simulation to study team cognition in emergency crisis management", author: "Michael D McNeese, Vincent F Mancuso, Michael D McNeese, Tristan Endsley, Pete Forster", link: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G1CnZ38AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=50&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=G1CnZ38AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", abstract: "BACKGROUND: Teamwork has become one of the hallmarks of emergency crisis management (ECM). Success in managing emergency situations is highly dependent on teams working together to accomplish prioritized goals. Therefore, given the importance of teamwork, team cognition has been realized as an important component to address the emerging complexity, extreme workload, and uncertain conditions that can underlie emergency response. Many variables affect teams and their subsequent cognition. Understanding the effects of awareness, attention, temporality, common ground, team mental model development, and culture on team cognition provides insight into effective and efficient management of emergencies. As a research group, for more than a decade, we have studied team cognition within the context of ECM through the basis of simulations using the NeoCITIES platform. The purpose of this paper is to share\u00a0\u2026"},
{title: "Exploring the perceptions and use of electronic medical record systems by non-clinicians", author: "Alison R Murphy, Madhu C Reddy, Nathan J McNeese", link: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G1CnZ38AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=G1CnZ38AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", abstract: "BACKGROUND: Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are used by a wide variety of users. However, current research on the design and use of the EMR primarily focuses on clinical users such as physicians and nurses. While it is important to understand EMR use by clinicians, there is also a need to understand how non-clinicians use these systems because of the important role they play in the patient-care process. In this note, we present results of an ethnographic field study on the use and perceptions of EMR systems by non-clinicians in an emergency department. We then discuss design implications that can improve the system usability and strengthen the empowerment of these non-clinicians."},
{title: "Exploring the Relationship Between Ethics and Trust in Human\u2013Artificial Intelligence Teaming: A Mixed Methods Approach", author: "Claire Textor, Rui Zhang, Jeremy Lopez, Beau G Schelble, Nathan J McNeese, Guo Freeman,  ...", link: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G1CnZ38AAAAJ&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=G1CnZ38AAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", abstract: "BACKGROUND: Advancements and implementations of autonomous systems coincide with an increased concern for the ethical implications resulting from their use. This is increasingly relevant as autonomy fulfills teammate roles in contexts that demand ethical considerations. As AI teammates (ATs) enter these roles, research is needed to explore how an AT\u2019s ethics influences human trust. This current research presents two studies which explore how an AT\u2019s ethical or unethical behavior impacts trust in that teammate. In Study 1, participants responded to scenarios of an AT recommending actions which violated or abided by a set of ethical principles. The results suggest that ethicality perceptions and trust are influenced by ethical violations, but only ethicality depends on the type of ethical violation. Participants in Study 2 completed a focus group interview after performing a team task with a simulated AT that committed ethical\u00a0\u2026"},

Specifically, we identify the research environments, dependent variables, themes representing the key findings, and critical future research directions.BACKGROUND: Whereas a burgeoning literature on high-performance teamwork identifies the factors critical to success, much less is known about how human\u2013autonomy teams (HATs) achieve success. Human\u2013autonomy teamwork involves humans working interdependently toward a common goal along with autonomous agents. Autonomous agents involve a degree of self-government and self-directed behavior (agency), and autonomous agents take on a unique role or set of tasks and work interdependently with human team members to achieve a shared objective."},
{title: "The Role of Team Cognition In Collaborative Information Seeking During Team Decision-Making", author: "Nathaniel James Mcneese", link: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G1CnZ38AAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=G1CnZ38AAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Team decision-making is a process composed of many activities. One important activity is collaborative information seeking (CIS). CIS takes place when \u201ctwo or more individuals work together to seek needed information in order to satisfy a goal\u201d(Karunakaran &amp; Reddy, 2012). Consequently, CIS can play an important role in team decision-making. Current CIS research has focused on (1) examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational and other settings and (2) developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. However, most CIS research has overlooked the cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, there is little research examining CIS from a team cognitive perspective. Often, the development of team cognition positively improves the team decision-making process (Cooke et al., 2003). Specifically, the development of team mental models, a team cognitive construct, has often been identified as a way to help teams complete their work (Lim &amp; Klein, 2006). However, the relationship of CIS and team cognition has never fully been explored. In this dissertation, my four main research objectives were to (a) explore how teams approach CIS;(b) develop a conceptual understanding of team cognition during CIS;(c) understand the impact and affect of a co-located and distributed setting on team\u2019s CIS approaches and the development of team cognition, and (d) develop design guidelines for information technologies that will support multiple CIS approaches and the development of team cognition during CIS. To meet my research objectives, I conducted two separate qualitative laboratory studies of undergraduate student teams\u00a0\u2026"},
{title: "The wisdom of the market: Using human factors to design prediction markets for collective intelligence", author: "Lorenzo Barberis Canonico, Christopher Flathmann, Nathan McNeese", link: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G1CnZ38AAAAJ&cstart=50&pagesize=50&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=G1CnZ38AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", abstract: "BACKGROUND: There is an ever-growing literature on the power of prediction markets to harness \u201cthe wisdom of the crowd\u201d from large groups of people. However, traditional prediction markets are not designed in a human-centered way, often restricting their own potential. This creates the opportunity to implement a cognitive science perspective on how to enhance the collective intelligence of the participants. Thus, we propose a new model for prediction markets that integrates human factors, cognitive science, game theory and machine learning to maximize collective intelligence. We do this by first identifying the connections between prediction markets and collective intelligence, to then use human factors techniques to analyze our design, culminating in the practical ways with which our design enables artificial intelligence to complement human intelligence."},

One important aspect of TDM is information seeking, particularly collaborative information seeking (CIS). Within CIS research, the role of team cognition and the development of team mental models (TMMs) have not been well-studied. In this paper, we examine the development of TMMs during CIS activities. Utilizing qualitative knowledge elicitation methods, we conducted an exploratory laboratory-based study of student teams working on CIS tasks. We report on how the teams describe TMM development, the teamwork and taskwork aspects of the TMM, and the attributes supporting TMM development. The results highlight that the process of TMM development during CIS is similar to TMM development research reported in other studies. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to attempt to understand the role of team cognition\u00a0\u2026"},

Current work practices typically do not provide a comprehensive approach that emphasizes the role of and interplay between (a) cognition, (b) emergent activities in a shared situated context, and (c) collaborative teamwork. In turn, effective and efficient problem solving fails to take place, and practice is often composed of piecemeal, techno-centric tools that isolate analysts by providing rigid, limited levels of understanding of situation awareness. This coupled with the fact that many analyst activities are classified produces a challenging situation for researching such phenomena and designing and evaluating systems to support analyst cognition and teamwork. Through our work with cyber, image, and intelligence analysts we have realized that there is\u00a0\u2026"},
