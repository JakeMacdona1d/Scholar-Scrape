{title: "Adapt and overcome: Perceptions of adaptive autonomous agents for human-AI teaming", author: "Allyson I Hauptman, Beau G Schelble, Nathan J McNeese, Kapil Chalil Madathil", link: "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=G1CnZ38AAAAJ&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=G1CnZ38AAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", abstract: "BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in AI technologies have caused teams to explore the use of AI agents as full, active members of the team. The complex environments that teams occupy require human team members to constantly adapt their behaviors, and thus the ability of AI teammates to similarly adapt to changing situations significantly enhances the team\u2019s chances to succeed. In order to design such agents, it is important that we understand not only how to identify the amount of autonomous control AI agents have over their decisions, but also how changes to this control cognitively affects the rest of the team. Professional organizations often break their work cycles into phases that set limits on the team members\u2019 actions, and we propose that a similar process could be used to define the autonomy levels of AI teammates. Cyber incident response is an ideal context for this proposal, as we were able to use incident response\u00a0\u2026"},

Specifically, we identify the research environments, dependent variables, themes representing the key findings, and critical future research directions.BACKGROUND: Whereas a burgeoning literature on high-performance teamwork identifies the factors critical to success, much less is known about how human\u2013autonomy teams (HATs) achieve success. Human\u2013autonomy teamwork involves humans working interdependently toward a common goal along with autonomous agents. Autonomous agents involve a degree of self-government and self-directed behavior (agency), and autonomous agents take on a unique role or set of tasks and work interdependently with human team members to achieve a shared objective."},
