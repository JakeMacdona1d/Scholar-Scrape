The complex environments that teams occupy require human team members to constantly adapt their behaviors, and thus the ability of AI teammates to similarly adapt to changing situations significantly enhances the team\u2019s chances to succeed. In order to design such agents, it is important that we understand not only how to identify the amount of autonomous control AI agents have over their decisions, but also how changes to this control cognitively affects the rest of the team. Professional organizations often break their work cycles into phases that set limits on the team members\u2019 actions, and we propose that a similar process could be used to define the autonomy levels of AI teammates. Cyber incident response is an ideal context for this proposal, as we were able to use incident response\u00a0\u2026"},

One of those contexts that has only recently been receiving much attention is human-AI teaming, where an AI agent operates an interdependent teammate, rather than a tool. These teams present unique challenges in creating and maintaining shared team understanding, specifically when it comes to a shared team ethical code. Because teams change in composition, goals, and environments it is imperative that AI teammates be capable of updating their ethical codes in concert with their human teammates. This paper proposes a two-part model in order to implement a dynamic ethical code for AI teammates in human-AI teams. The first part of the model proposes that the ethical code, in addition to its team role, be used to inform an adaptive AI-agent of when and how to adapt its level of autonomy. The second part of the model explains how that ethical code is consistently updated based upon the AI agent\u2019s iterative observations of team interactions. This model makes multiple contributions to the community of human-centered computing, because teams with higher levels of team cognition exhibit higher levels of performance and longevity. More importantly, it proposes a model for more ethical use of AI teammates on human-AI teams that is applicable to a variety of human-AI teaming contexts and permits room for future innovation."},

Many of these applications include the creation of human-artificial intelligence (AI) teams, which promise to increase the already known advantages of working in team environments. The efficacy of the AI agents that make up these teams has always been a significant focus. However, a shift from technical ability to social abilities has occurred. A newfound emphasis on trust within these human-AI teams has prompted research on supporting trust between humans and AI teammates, how AI affects trust between the humans within the team, and how team composition (majority AI versus majority human) influences trust development. Even the efficacy of trust repair strategies, adapted from human-automation interaction, is being explored in human-AI teaming. In the current paper, we examine an essential component of trust that has yet to receive requisite attention: the spread of trust within and across constellations of teams. To this end, we discuss the potential impacts of trust within and across human-AI teams and constellations on team efficacy. From this discussion, several challenges are proposed in five major research questions that should be addressed to enable more effective human-AI teams and human-AI teaming constellations."},

Yet, how technology co-use, such as co-playing digital games, affords and impacts parent-child relationships is still understudied. Using 20 in-depth interviews of adults who had co-played modern digital games with their parents and/or children, in this paper we investigate parent-child relationships mediated by co-playing modern digital games. We update prior HCI and CHI PLAY research on game-mediated parent-child relationships by suggesting a \"democratized\" family life and a fading digital divide for families with favorable digital game co-play experiences. We also contribute to HCI and CHI PLAY by providing new perspectives of technology co-use in the context of gaming, such as an important relational tool that parents can use to promote conversations with their child(ren).

Balls launched onto an infield at different trajectories were filmed using four video cameras that were each placed at one of the typical positions of the four infielders. Each participant viewed temporally occluded videos for one of the four positions and were asked to say either \u201cball\u201d if they would attempt to field it or the name of the bag that they would cover. The evaluation of two experienced coaches was used to assign a group coordination score for each trajectory and group decision times were calculated. Thirty groups of 4 current college baseball players were: (i) teammates (players from same team/view from own position), (ii) non-teammates (players from different teams/view from own position), or (iii) scrambled teammates (players from same team/view not from own position). Teammates performed significantly better (i.e., faster and more coordinated decisions) than the other two groups, whereas scrambled teammates performed significantly better than non-teammates. These findings suggest that team coordination is achieved through both experience with one\u2019s teammates\u2019 responses to particular events (e.g., a ball hit up the middle) and one's own general action capabilities (e.g., running speed).

Similar to human-human teaming, there are multiple dimensions of social behaviors that occur during HAT that must be accounted for within the development of the agent or system. One of these dimensions is team synchrony. In general, team synchrony is, when two systems (or two individuals in a team) are synchronized, resulting in their recurrences being dependent on each other. In order for a human-autonomy team to be synchronous the agent must communicate effectively (i.e., synchronize effectively) with its human team members. Thus, in this paper we present a conceptual discussion on what team synchrony is, how it occurs, and how to better develop it in HAT. To ground our discussion, we use our recent studies in which we empirically looked at team behaviors and team synchrony\u00a0\u2026"},

We summarize the findings from three of our recent experiments regarding the team interaction within HAT over time in the dynamic context of RPAS. For the first and the second experiments, we summarize general findings related to team member interaction of a three-member team over time, by comparison of HATs with all-human teams.

We do this by first identifying the connections between prediction markets and collective intelligence, to then use human factors techniques to analyze our design, culminating in the practical ways with which our design enables artificial intelligence to complement human intelligence."},

Additionally, recent developments in reinforcement learning artificial intelligence have led to artificial agents cooperating more efficiently with humans, especially in more complex environments. This research conducts an empirical study to understand how different modern reinforcement learning algorithms and game theory scenarios could create different cooperation levels in human-machine teams. Three different reinforcement learning algorithms (Vanilla Policy Gradient, Proximal Policy Optimization, and Deep Q-Network) and two different game theory scenarios (Hawk Dove and Prisoners dilemma) were examined in a large-scale experiment. The results indicated that different reinforcement learning models interact differently with humans with Deep-Q engendering higher cooperation levels. The Hawk Dove game theory scenario elicited significantly higher levels of cooperation in the human-artificial intelligence system.
